optitrack
=========

A C driver for communicating with an OptiTrack camera over VRPN.

The makefile expects there to be a directory called 'vrpn' that houses the VRPN code, which has been compiled for your system.  Also, you will most likely have to modify the makefile slightly to look in the appropriate directory for the VRPN libs.
